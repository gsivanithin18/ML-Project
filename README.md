# Heart Disease Predictor
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the risk of heart disease. The model was developed using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Introduction
Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease caused 659,000 deaths in 2020. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk of heart disease, so that people can take steps to reduce their risk.

## Data Collection
The data for this project was collected from the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. This dataset contains 13 features, including age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate. The target variable is whether or not the patient has heart disease.

## Data Analysis
The data was analyzed using the Python libraries Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. The data was cleaned and preprocessed, and then the features were explored using visualizations.

## Model Development
A logistic regression model was developed using the Scikit-learn library. The model was trained on the training data, and then the performance was evaluated on the test data. The model achieved an accuracy of 88%.

## Conclusion
The results of this project show that it is possible to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk of heart disease with a high degree of accuracy. This model could be used to help people reduce their risk of heart disease by taking steps to improve their health.

## Future Work
In the future, this project could be extended by using other machine learning models, such as decision trees and support vector machines. The data could also be expanded to include more features, such as lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise.
