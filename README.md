# ML-Project
• Developed a logistic regression model achieving
88% accuracy in classification tasks.
• Explored and experimented with different ma‐
chine learning models, including KNN and Ran‐
dom Forest Classifier.
• Utilized grid search and random search tech‐
niques to optimize hyperparameters for each
model.
• Analysed the data using different Python libraries
like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.
